# OOP-C#

This repository contains the **programming tasks** completed as part of the **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** unit during my **second semester** at university (**Aug 2024**). These tasks, which form one component of the broader unit, focus on essential OOP concepts such as **class design**, **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, **abstraction**, **encapsulation**, **exception handling**, and **unit testing**.  

While the unit covered various aspects beyond programming, this repository is specifically dedicated to showcasing the coding exercises that strengthened my understanding of object-oriented principles and enhanced my skills in **C#**.
